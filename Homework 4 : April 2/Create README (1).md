For Homework 4, we were to create an interactive line path chart with our own CSV data.
I created a CSV with data on temperature measured in Celsius, collected in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil from 1991-2021, which is called Rio-Data99-21.csv.
The data was gathered from this website: https://en.climate-data.org/south-america/brazil/rio-de-janeiro-208/r/march-3/.
The temperatures were recorded at average, minimum and maximum values.
The code attached demonstrates the construction of interactive line path.
The screenshots show the different interactions of the line chart, the first showing the averagep temp, the second showing the minimum temp and the third showing the maximum temp.
