This is my final project, I have completed a pie chart with a tooltip that shows the title of the pie chart.
I also created a scatter plot that uses a tool tip to navigate the "items". 
These two graphs were completed using data from https://cdn.sanity.io/files/6u5teakk/production/333041e21b5517d52c75489023354c6d68bd0037.pdf?dl=.
I modified the data to be able to fit the needs of each graph.
