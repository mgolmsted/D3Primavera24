For this last homework assignment, I created a pie chart using data that demonstrates top Afro Latine populations worldwide. 
This chart has a title that is hidden because of the const values, but there is a title somewhere beneath there.
This chart uses many different colors and because some slices of the pie chart are so small, the names of the countries are tough to read. 
The .csv attached to this HW provides clarity on these names.
