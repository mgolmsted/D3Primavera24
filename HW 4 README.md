For Week 4's Homework, I created a .csv that had data on number of social media posts per month. 
I created a bar chart with the data from the .csv and chose to make the bars yellow. 
The x-axis demonstrates the months (January to July), while the y-axis demonstrates the progression of months (7 in total).
